# Projects completed at Metis data science bootcamp
This repository consists of data science projects and programming code that I worked on at the Spring 2020 cohort.

1. [MTA Project](https://github.com/dgourianov/metis_projects/tree/master/Project_1_mta)  uses NYC subway data to help a sports drink maker find the best subway stations to place promotional teams
1. [Life Expectancy Across Countries Project](https://github.com/dgourianov/metis_projects/tree/master/Project_2_life_expectancy) uses linear regression to identify major determinants of life expectancy in different countries
1. [Instacart](https://github.com/dgourianov/metis_projects/tree/master/Project_3_instacart)  - Predicting Whether a Product Will Be Reordered
Predicted repeated orders by consumers using classification algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
1. [Assessing the 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidates using NLP](https://github.com/dgourianov/metis_projects/tree/master/Project_4_debates)  
I applied Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis and Cosine Similarity to the transcripts of speeches of six candidates
1. [Food Image Classification Using Deep Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/dgourianov/metis_projects/tree/master/Project_5_food_image_class)   
I built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify 107 categories of food images. Performed model training and hyperparameter optimization on Google Cloud Platform
