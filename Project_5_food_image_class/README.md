Project 5 - Food Image Classification Using Deep Learning Algorithms

In this project I built built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify 107 categories of food images.     
I applied Transfer Learning framework to improve model's metrics and developed a  Flask web app to make model available for end-users.   

A video presentation of my project is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T60UXE-hwrY&feature=youtu.be)
